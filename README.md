# Bard Speaks
 Speech synthesis automatically plays for bard output. Requires [Bard for Google](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/bard-for-google/hnadleianomnjcoeplifgbkiejchjmah) browser extension.

 It would be easy to modify to work on the normal Bard website too, but I prefer the extension.

 ## Usage
 
 It automatically plays the speech synthesis at full volume as soon as Bard loads a text answer.

 ## Recommended further work for the user, if they want to go all out
 
 I currectly hold my Macbook dictate key, let go when I'm done speaking, which directly uses OpenAI Whisper API to get text, passes it to a Google search a Edge browser background tab, which speaks Bards answer aloud. I use BetterTouchTool for the hotkey, Apple Shortcuts to communicate with OpenAI servers, Background Tab extension to keep spawned google results in the background instead of defaulting to the foreground, and the Bard speech plays. It's all seamless and automatic, as though the single Macbook key is a working intercom for the A.I..
